Formula for Compound Interest
The maturity amount 
𝐴
A for a fixed deposit is calculated using the compound interest formula:

𝐴=𝑃×(1+𝑟/𝑛)^𝑛𝑡
 

Where:
A is the maturity amount.

P is the principal amount (initial deposit).
𝑟
r is the annual interest rate (in decimal form, so 5% becomes 0.05).
𝑛
n is the number of times interest is compounded per year.
𝑡
t is the time the money is invested for, in years.
